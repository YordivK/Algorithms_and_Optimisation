The bfs file contains a function bfs that gives the value for k and the path of both players a and b.
The graph file contain a function graph that creates a graph representation in the form of a dictionary: {node1: [neighbor1, neighbor2], node2: [neighbor1, neighbor2]}.
The output file is the file that you need to run to use bfs on a given graph in order to get the output that is asked in the assignment.
The output_example file is the file that reads the output of a given graph to compare our results to the given results.
The reader file is the file that reads the input file and tells you all the information in the input. This is not necessary for the assignment, but might help with understanding the input.
The test_distance file is the file that calculates the distance between two nodes in a graph to check whether our results are correct.
